pam_stress — The stress-testing PAM module

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_stress PAM module is mainly intended to give the impression of failing
as a fully functioning module might.

OPTIONS

debug

    Put lots of information in syslog. *NOTE* this option writes passwords to
    syslog, so don't use anything sensitive when testing.

no_warn

    Do not give warnings about things (otherwise warnings are issued via the
    conversation function)

use_first_pass

    Do not prompt for a password, for pam_sm_authentication function just use
    item PAM_AUTHTOK.

try_first_pass

    Do not prompt for a password unless there has been no previous
    authentication token (item PAM_AUTHTOK is NULL)

rootok

    This is intended for the pam_sm_chauthtok function and it instructs this
    function to permit root to change the user's password without entering the
    old password.

expired

    An argument intended for the account and chauthtok module parts. It
    instructs the module to act as if the user's password has expired

fail_1

    This instructs the module to make its first function fail.

fail_2

    This instructs the module to make its second function (if there is one)
    fail.

prelim

    For pam_sm_chauthtok, means fail on PAM_PRELIM_CHECK.

required

    For pam_sm_chauthtok, means fail if the user hasn't already been
    authenticated by this module. (See stress_new_pwd data string in the
    NOTES.)
